<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditionally,&nbsp;<strong>physical health</strong>&nbsp;has been defined as the absence of disease or serious illness. However, in recent years, modern medicine has changed this viewpoint. The World Health Organization has expanded the definition of health beyond the scope of sickness and disease. The WHO now defines&nbsp;<strong>health&nbsp;</strong>in the sense of the overall well-being of a person, physically, mentally, and socially. These aspects are intricately linked, and the health of an individual encompasses all of them.</p>

<p>Physical and mental health have a very close connection. Poor mental health puts a person at a greater risk of chronic physical conditions. Additionally, chronic physical conditions are linked with an increased risk of poor mental health. This connection is not only seen between physical and mental health. Physical health is linked to all of the other dimensions of health. If a person's physical health declines, this often leads to a decline in the other areas. For example, if a person is battling a serious illness, this can lead to a decline in social well-being. The person may avoid others because of contagiousness or simply because of a decreased desire to be around others. This, in turn, can lead to sadness, which is a decline in mental and emotional health.</p>
